Funding the Animal Planet 

The sleek grey Fin cuts through the cold dark water, as 
winding lines of Ants march over sun warmed blankets 

Fin: predator's signal.  
Ant's miniature colonies organized around scraps. 

Fin: prowling, destructive 
Ants: clinging, scurrying, striving 

Fin: Slowly circling, waiting to strike. 
Ants: drudging along, waiting to collapse 

How will you pay for college? 
Afford a car? 
Buy a house? 

Finance it, with student loans. 
Finance it, with monthly payments. 
Finance it, with a lifetime mortgage. 

Predator and prey are separated by only a pronunciation. 
The pompous say fin-ants, the rest finance away their lives.
