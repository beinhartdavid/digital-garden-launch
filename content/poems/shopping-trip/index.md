Shopping Trip 

Swinging around corners 
Splintering form sidewalks to streets 
Cascading around cars 
Multitudes of Maskless 
Amble along their way 

While I scurry 
And I pace 
Unsure of where to be 
Or what air to 
Displace 

There is no spacing or direction for facing that 
will provide me cover. 

And so i wait and turn tip toeing, 
Anxiety growing 
As the virus around me keeps flowing.
