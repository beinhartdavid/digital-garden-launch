Smithfield's Super 8 Motel 

A long day 
spent on the road 
7 sticky hours in a van 
Head pressed to window 

Wearily greeting
extended family: 
Mother's ques. 
Thoughts on acerbic words 

Grandmom's cookies, 
at long last: 
rationed criticsim. 
Head on swivel

Dinner & 
Discussions: 
Enduring "conversations" 
Phone Hidden in Lap 

Parting goodbyes 
for the night: 
"It's so good to see you's" 
Hands in pockets 

A dog soundly 
sleeping
our beagle in a bed, 
snout on pillow 

culminating in 
continental breakfast: 
Departures' dry danishes 
Smile on face 

Imperfect memories 
of family since passed: 
Strained relationships of another family's past. 
Tears not found. 

Revision 

A long day spent on the road
7 sticky hours in a van 
Head pressed to window for relief, 
one less ear to absorb idle bickering and ambient anxieties
as my Father's thousand-yard stare steers us all along

Arriving 
We wearily extend greetings to
extended family: 
Mother's ques. 
Thoughts on acerbic words 

Grandmom's cookies, 
at long last: 
rationed criticsim. 
Head on swivel

Dinner & 
Discussions: 
Enduring "conversations" 
Phone Hidden in Lap 

Parting goodbyes 
for the night: 
"It's so good to see you's" 
Hands in pockets 

A dog soundly 
sleeping
our beagle in a bed, 
snout on pillow 

culminating in 
continental breakfast: 
Departures' dry danishes 
Smile on face 

Imperfect memories 
of family since passed: 
Strained relationships of another family's past. 
Tears not found.
