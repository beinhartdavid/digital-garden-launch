A Winter's Walk 

The black outline 
of his plump fingers 
held precariously 
the graham colored vessel. 

Within each stride, 
he cautiously checked two fold, 
for ice along the sidewalk 
as well as melting cream
along the cone. 

For the gentle stich where 
the waffle folded over 
provided a ridge by which 
drips flowed. 

Along his trek, 
balance had to be found. 

If he was overly cautious 
ior his tongue too slow, 
the melted ice-cream would seep
into the thin napkin 

Which would just fine, 
if it didn't also 
cake up against 
his shelled leather gloves. 

At the sight of which, 
given the cost of them
caused him an exasperated sigh. 

Huffing out, his breathe
suspended below the clouds. 
Vapor visible by its freezing, 
make warm thoughts
all the more teasing
