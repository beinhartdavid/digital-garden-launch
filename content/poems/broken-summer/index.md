Broken Summer 

outside his cheecks are as bright
as a ripe slice of watermellon 

& the tip of his nose has 
been dabbed white by a hasty peck 

as the scattered sand 
crunches under his bare feet 

before he pauses, smiles & waves 
to the perched guard 

approaching the water's boundary 
he removed the white linen from 
around his neck...

for his cheeks are actually numb
whipped by winter's fierce winds 

his nose is frozen over, 
while his pudgy digits remain cozy 

covered by excess fabric 
that absorbs the stream 

his precarious gloved grip 
around the cone loosens 

as he sees the orderly
bounding towards him 

and the sterile robe 
that lies crumpled ar 

the edge of the snow bank
stained by his ice cream
