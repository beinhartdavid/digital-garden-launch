What We Know to be Man's Best Friend 

Midway through his second semester 
of college, my brother recieved 
a frantic text from his ex. 

"Gunny is sick and I don't know
what to do, but I know what 
my dog meant to you." 

Long distance hadn't worked 
And yet within the hour 
he was racing  back to by by her side 
****

Despite the initail awkwardness
It was as if he had never left, 
Gunny had a limp and was prone to howl, 

but as the months began to melt, 
into summer's muggy humidity,
it was clear that the dog was fine. 

***

Their trip was eventually punctured 
by the cruel march of time 
but the couple remained intertwined 

After many more loving 
memories, Gunny did pass
But now the married couple 

have no doubts that they will last. 
They insist to friends that raising 
a dog is great preparation for kids
