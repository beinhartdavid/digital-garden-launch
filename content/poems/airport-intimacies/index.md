Airport Intimacies 

Walking through the empty 
terminal, I clutch my carry-on
tightly to my chest 

The strap is broken
and my feet are blistered, 
my smile has since wavered 

But the gurgling and guggling 
of the bottles within the bag 
beat more truly than my heart

10 bottles of rum 
tightly sealed, 
plastic, duty free 

338.14 more shots 
at happiness
