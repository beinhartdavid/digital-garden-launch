Thalia 
Ann Arbor, 
and Wherever Else the Grass is Green 

The small football 
team is romanticized 

in the hearts 
& 
in the stories 
of the towns 

As much about football 
as trying 
& 
(failing) to fit in

tales canonizing 
rivalries, comebacks and 
the coming of age upon
summer's searing hot 
gridiron. 

Despite the gamut being wrung out of 
blood stained, 
sweat soaked, 
dare I venture 
tear seasoned jerseys
the ballplayers are allowed but one emotion, 
and one emotions only: 

ENTHUSIASM! 

which rules all, 
for anything else indicts: 
indicating lack of heart and commitment to the team

But below the protection of pads and beyond the structure of plays 
churned without label: 
desire for violence, lust of copulation, fear of shame and pride in hustle. 

Timeless seasons
suspended pages at a time
By the likes of 
Larry McMurty, Elwood Reid and Buzz Bissinger 

As they describe small towns 
real, far and all in-between 
gripped in Friday night's frenzy 
as them boys come out and the band goes on
