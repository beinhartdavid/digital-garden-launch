Childhood Vacations 

Once summer itself had spots, well, 
just plain holes.A 3-month expanse
of sun filled play to fall into day after day. 

Once the garage had spots that were, well, 
unexplored. Nooks and crannies best for hide 
and seek and a ladder-less loft worth the climb. 

Once the brown wicker basket had spots that were, well, 
worn. A rigid handle's use, compromised 
by hunger's bulging picnic supplies. 

Once the soft red blanket had spots that were, well 
toughened dried drips. Deviations in the fabric's feel 
formed from melting cones and haphazardly placed cans. 

Once the wide blue umbrella had spots that were, well, 
wide and blue. Shade, with peeks from an expansive sky. 
Slits sheared through by a careless toss along the opening of a trunk. 

Once the bright green pail had spots that were, well, 
pale. Brittle from the sun's warmth and yet still molding 
wet cement-like sand along the pounding surf. 

Once our family's story had spots, well, 
punknown. 
Before history combined with prolonged UV, was exposed too late to save.
