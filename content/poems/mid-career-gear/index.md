Mid Career Gear 

He had been assured his position was safe. 
After all he was indispensable 
If not bulletproof, certainly commendable 

Wasn't it everyone else that was 
So damn expendable? 

But had his view not been so fixed he would have seen
his replacements were expandable 
Not quite as valuable,
But salaries fractional 

Resigned he closed the door 
And sobbed softly 
In leased luxury
A choice now irredeemably irrational
