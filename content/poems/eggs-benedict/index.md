"& 
I hope 
she knows 
that you only like the beginining of things" 

Pam looked down at me and forced a smile. 
Her hand traced the same lazy path as so many times before, 
jotting down my mundane order. 

I can't bring myself to look up at her, 
not tonight, not for this final time. 
Instead I hunch, 
as my hands fidget across the booth. 

While I do not need the
laminated sheet 
I still grip its sticky corner, 
How thin it is 

And yet still Robust and bristling, 
small text dimly illuminated 
by chrome-reflected neon.

For years the Diner had been my refuge 
Open 24/7, it did not 
have much to hide 

Now, sober, stomach turning, my shadowy
deceits in the morning's light. 
My swirling cream preceding the lightening sky
agitated by the spoon in hand 

The pale band of my finger 
no longer in my pocket as before, 
after years of broken vowels now constantly (re)stored
