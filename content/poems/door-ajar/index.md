Door Ajar 

1) Visible from afar, is a door left 
2) ajar, and surely so too are the threats. 
3) For fleeting swings, and momentary stops 
4) Invite the piercing cold winds of winter 
5) into an otherwise cozy abode 
6) Even on the other side of the knob, 
7) who would allow their artificially 
8) made respite to so easily escape 
9) into the dark blistering heat of a 
10) summer's night? Not to mention prowling thieves. 


Could be a fun series, discuss minor inconveniences in great detail with a reoccuring piunchline of the obvious danger, perhaps the same thing, prowling thieves.
