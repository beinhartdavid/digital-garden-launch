Food Network Fights 

Over the shoulder of 
The slovenly dressed host, 
The chef beamed brightly 
as he held the golden crusted pizza. 

"I get the cheese locally," 
he said with pride. 
Nodding sympathetically the host 
silently urged him to continue

"I also get the tomatoes from a local 
supplier," adds the chef. 
Nodding once more the host 
shifts his weights from 
brightly patterned sneaker to
brightly patterned sneaker 

"And of course even the yeast
is local as well." 

Sure the host lazily says
with a nod of his head, 
"and the wheat and the basil, 
and even the crushed red pepper" 

It seems as if the oven must be back on or 
the lights used for the camera are too bright, 
because the chef is now sweating profusely 

And then with a flash he isn't 
the screen if filled by 
basketball players drenched in 
their own form of perspiration 

Annoyed I look over to my husband, 
"What, you wanted to keep 
listening to that pizzeria stuff?
Wisconsin ain't that big"
