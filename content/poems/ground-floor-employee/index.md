Ground Floor Employee

"You are the first generation 
that's willing to work for free candy. 
My generation would never have fallen 
for that. We wanted to get paid in actual money" 
- Dan Lyons 

I realized that working for salary was for chumps: 
with what I had left in my account I was set out west. 

Trading tailored suits for fitted hoodies, 
the hours remained largely the same
but while wearing my New 991's 
I felt I had found Balance, at least for a while. 

I believed my coworkers were family 
I believed our culture was pure 
I believed our work had purpose. 
I believed I was changing the world 

Burning venture capital dollars 
Faster than anticipated 
the glitz of it all began to wane 
I felt as washed up as the masses 
I passed on Market or in the Mission 

I realized that working, 
no living to work 
Was Not Working 
grounded down 
I finally saw beyond the Valley's facade.
