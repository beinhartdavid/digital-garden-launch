Surprising Statistics on Student Alcohol Use 

Whether from lack of sleep or too much to drink, my headaches
feel the same. A dull pain that bothers me throughout the day. 
A sore reminder to chide yesterday's many mistakes. 
Which of course I consider, and their impact on my grades. 

Even mistakes that seem unimportant or that are small
can quickly add up from both addition and subtraction. 
A case comp over the weekend of friends t
hat want to ball
can bring more or less work but still serve as a distraction. 

Pathetically, alcohol is rarely the problem found. 
Mentioning my school should explain the balance of my pain. 
CMU is known for the type of work that wears you down. 
With a lot to do and an increasing standard to maintain. 

There simply is not enough time in the day to get it all done. 
Drunk due to lack od sleep, I wonder if this is fun.
