Mines

Fear of dark ingrained in the child
as much as dream's of the sky's 
ever limitless possibilities 

Contradictions abound 
set forth to explore what lays hidden 
in us and the grounds we inhabit 

The tools vary from station to station: 
some given patronizing pails of bright 
colors and restricting black & white rules 

Others born on shafts already dug 
Claiming they excavated the land 
winning fortunes through their hands 

All preoccupied in a race to live 
& distinguish between 
what is theirs and what is mines
