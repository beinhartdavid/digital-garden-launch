This is a Google App Script project I wrote after seeing a "Project Manager Checklist" that was being used within my company. It was a simple PDF with 3 columns used to track deliverables. 1 column listed the various activities, the next deadlines and the last the status of each line item. Given that a project started on X date, the deliverables would be staggered out in defined intervals:
 
 <em> Within 1 week complete A, within the first month B and within 90 days J with C-I sprinkled in between. </em>

I felt however that this process could be improved. The actual activities were blackboxes, I had no real input on whether PMs should be doing A-J or on what timeline. If this were to look at this process more critically, I would consider these aspects but as such I just wanted to improve the documentation, the PDF.
