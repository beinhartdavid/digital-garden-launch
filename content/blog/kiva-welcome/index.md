I quietly launched the David Beinhart Foundation to Change the World, for the Better of Course in August, at least unofficially. At the heart of it, I've wanted to start loaning money through [Kiva](www.kiva.org) and so without any further effort setting up a phoney 501c3 (I still might) started making loans. See my early post here outlining this if none of this makes sense (it still might not). 

At the time of writing, I've loaned $1,050 across 17 countries with an additional $56 being donated to Kiva to help with transaction fees and administration of these loans. 

The exciting thing is that I've already been partially repaid by a number of those in my "portfolio" and with an overall 98% repayment rate across Kiva can expect that to continue. 

My goal of loaning $1 million dollars is based on this assumption that the money will be repaid to some extent. The calculation for how I will be able to achieve this is based on a high school math concept that I had long forgotten. 

When I first tried to articulate this and gameify my modest impact into a more outlandish sum I was trying to express that the money would recirculate. Not only would I continue to give more money for loans, but previous loans would be reissued, an ever growing snowball that would over time chip away at my cumulative goal of $1 million dollars in loans. 

I had first thought of this as factorials but for addition. Somehow, I remember the concept of factorials expressed as N!, for example 5! being 5x4x3x2x1 or 120 sooner than I did Binomial Coefficients. Regardless, I did uncover the [formula I was looking for](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/593318/factorial-but-with-addition/593323)  and with $2,000 a year to loan will cross the $1,000,000 mark between my 31st and 32nd year of making loans! 

For more information on Binomial Coeffeicents open a book or something. This could be a fun excuse to revisit some mathematical concepts neglected since high school and a great example for how the proper calculations can help emphasize an idea or goal! 

And of course, check out my [Kiva lender page here](https://www.kiva.org/lender/davidbeinhart). It will update as I make loans and I am looking into other ways to visualize the information.
