### Intro:
Goal: I want to start a charitable foundation and help people.\
\
How: By making microfinance loans through Kiva

Obviously this is also a bit of a joke/vanity project. But the mission of the "David Beinhart Foundation to Change the World, for the Better of Course" is to do just that, change the world for the better of course. 

### Steps: 
1. "Create" the foundation 
    - Email address 
    - Bank account 
    - Kiva account 
    - 501(c)(3) or other required paperwork
2. Operate the foundation 
    - Transfer money to foundation
    - Loan funds through Kiva 
    - As loans are paid off, make new loans continuing the cycle. 
3. Document foundation 
    - Create a website 
    - Highlight stats/metrics: 
        - Dollars raised 
        - Dollars under management 
        - Number of loans made 
        - Total dollar amount of loans made 
4. Grow foundation 
    - Donations will cycle into further loans indefinitely 
    - Consider fundraising activities 
    - Pivot from microfinance 

### Questions: 
1. What should I do? (DUH)
2. Should I apply as a 501(c)(3)? 
3. How much money would this cost?
4. Would there be reoccurring costs? 
5. Are there other options to make this "official" 
6. Would I be better off doing this "unofficially" 
7. Would I be restricted from using the funds for something else in the future? 
    - (obviously still charitable)
    - Can the mission of the foundation be changed from microfinance? 
    - Can funds be transferred to other charities?
