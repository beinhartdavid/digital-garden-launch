Welcome to my "Digital Garden." It's a concept I've been thinking about for a while, but have yet to put into practice. I first heard about it on Twitter from [@jhooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) and you can learn more about his approach [here](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). Or from this [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) article on digital gardens. 

Since then, I've deleted my Twitter and besides an anemic [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-beinhart-141747b5) and high school football [highlights](https://www.hudl.com/video/3/828606/5721acc40c5e6812246decb1), have little online presence. All of which underscores the importance of a digital garden as a place to explore interests, build and maybe even have a bit of fun. 

Beyond that I'm not sure what to establish in terms of expectations or structure. Forgive me dear ambiguous reader *(but if we're being honest you're probably just me, maybe my supportive girlfriend Lisa)* because from now on, I will prioritize getting thoughts on paper, hands in digital dirt. 

**For too long I weaponized an ever growing list of technical to-do items to prevent me from getting started at all.**

User authentication came to embody this challenge. I didn't want a paid site that would flip a switch, but integrating Oauth services into a content-less site made little sense as well. Learning about front end development and writing requires getting started, not having the perfect setup. 

As much as I'd like to lock down my writing, I'll embrace the vastness of the internet. I'm likely alone, but anyone could be peering over my shoulder. 

So if you are, hi and welcome.
