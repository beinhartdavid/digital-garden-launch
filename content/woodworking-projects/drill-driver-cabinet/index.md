This was a project from Steve Ramsey's ____ Course. 
For more of my thoughts on Steve's courses see____ 

When I was building this I was using an undersized router bit and was not using the Dado stack in my table saw. This was really one of my first projects done with rabbits and dados and as such I wasn't quite sure how tight of a fit I should have. Well I had way to tight of a fit and you can actually see that it didn't come together as well as it should. Instead of using my clamps to provide light pressure during the glue up, I was cranking them to provide structural reinforcement, to force oversized shelves into undersized dado's. Thankfully everything has held up well despite this misalignment, a testament to the strength of this way of building more than anything else, dados are strong. 

But this has provided a great way of organizing the garage and for keeping crucial tools close at hand.
